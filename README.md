# Interactive-Pathfinding-Simulation-with-A*
An interactive Java Swing-based simulation that visually demonstrates the A* pathfinding algorithm. Users can set start/end points, draw obstacles, and watch the algorithm find the shortest path in real time across a grid. This project is designed for students, developers, and anyone interested in understanding advanced pathfinding and heuristic search methods.

üìå**Features**

**Interactive Grid:** 50√ó50 grid where users can set start/end points and place obstacles using the mouse.

**Real-Time Visualization**: Watch the A* algorithm expand from both start and end points simultaneously.

**Color-Coded States:**

White: Unexplored

Blue: Start

Yellow: End

Green: Open nodes

Red: Closed nodes

Purple: Final path

Black: Obstacles

**Reset & Replay:** Instantly clear the grid and rerun the algorithm with different scenarios.

**Educational Value:** Ideal for learning and teaching concepts of heuristic search, bidirectional search, and AI navigation.

‚öôÔ∏è**How It Works**

**Grid Setup:**
The application displays a 50√ó50 grid. Each cell can be a start, end, obstacle, or free node.

**User Interaction:**

**Left-click:** Set start/end points and draw obstacles.

**Right-click:** Reset individual cells.

**Drag:** Quickly add multiple obstacles.

**AStar Algorithm**

Explores the grid from start to end using a priority queue.

Calculates cost for each node:

g(n): Distance from start

h(n): Heuristic to end (e.g., Manhattan distance)

f(n) = g(n) + h(n)

Always expands the node with the lowest f(n).

Finds the shortest path if the heuristic is admissible.

**Bidirectional AStar Algorithm**

Runs two A* searches at the same time: one from the start, one from the end.

Each search expands nodes based on the lowest f(n).

Stops when the two searches meet.

Reconstructs the shortest path by connecting the meeting point.
